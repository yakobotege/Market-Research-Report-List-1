<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial X-ray Film for Nondestructive Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Screen Type Films</li><li>Screen Type Films</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial X-ray films for nondestructive testing are categorized into two main types: non-screen type films and screen type films. Non-screen type films are exposed directly to radiation, providing high resolution and contrast, making them suitable for detecting fine details in welds and materials. In contrast, screen type films are used in conjunction with intensifying screens that enhance image quality and reduce exposure time. This makes screen type films more efficient for larger area scans and faster inspections, catering to various industrial applications.</p></p>
