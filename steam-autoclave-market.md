<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steam Autoclave Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-vacuum Autoclave</li><li>Steam Flush Autoclave</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The steam autoclave market consists of two primary types: pre-vacuum autoclaves and steam flush autoclaves. Pre-vacuum autoclaves create a vacuum to remove air prior to steam penetration, ensuring thorough sterilization, particularly for porous materials. Steam flush autoclaves, on the other hand, use a combination of steam and pulsating vacuum technology to achieve sterilization, making them suitable for dense loads. Both types are essential in healthcare and laboratory settings for effective sterilization of surgical instruments and equipment.</p></p>
